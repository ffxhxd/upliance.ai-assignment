# 🍳 Upliance Recipe Builder & Smart Cooking Companion

A React application that allows users to create recipes and cook with guided step-by-step instructions, real-time timers, and automatic progress tracking. The application is built using React.js, Redux Toolkit, and Material-UI.

## Features

- **Recipe Management** - Create, edit, delete, and save recipes with ingredients and cooking steps
- **Smart Cooking Sessions** - Real-time cooking guidance with per-step countdown timers (mm:ss format)
- **Circular Progress Indicators** - Visual progress tracking for each step and overall recipe completion
- **Automatic Step Advancement** - Seamlessly transitions to next step when timer completes
- **STOP Button Control** - Ends current step; auto-advances to next (or ends session if final step)
- **Global Mini Player** - Control cooking from any page without losing session state
- **Single Session Constraint** - Only one recipe can cook at a time across the app
- **Local Persistence** - All recipes saved to localStorage with automatic sync
- **Filter & Sort** - Filter recipes by difficulty, sort by date or duration
- **Favorite System** - Mark and quickly access favorite recipes
- **Rich Notifications** - Real-time feedback for all actions (start, pause, resume, stop, complete)
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile, tablet, and desktop compatible
- **Pagination** - Efficient recipe browsing with pagination
- **Custom Error Pages** - Enhanced user experience with react-router-dom

## Best Industry Standard Practices Implemented

### Custom Hooks for Reusability
- `useTimer` hook for drift-safe timer logic with `Date.now()` delta calculation
- Maintains clear separation of concerns and promotes code reusability

### Centralized State Management
- Redux Toolkit slices (recipes, session, notifications) for centralized configuration
- Easy maintenance and debugging with Redux DevTools

### TypeScript for Type Safety
- Strong typing prevents runtime errors
- Mutually exclusive fields enforcement (cooking vs instruction steps)
- Compile-time validation of Recipe constraints

### Compact, Readable Components
- Components designed to be concise (80-150 lines)
- Each component has a single, focused responsibility
- Improved readability and ease of maintenance

### Drift-Safe Timer Implementation
- Uses `Date.now()` delta calculation instead of naive `setInterval`
- Maintains ±100ms accuracy even with browser throttling
- Reduces timer drift by accounting for actual elapsed time

### DRY Principle Adhered To
- No repetitive code; utility functions in utils folder
- Reusable components prevent duplication
- Consistent patterns across application

### Single Responsibility Principle Maintained
- Each component handles one concern
- Redux slices isolated by domain (recipes, session, notifications)
- Utility functions separated by purpose

### Clean, Optimized, and Scalable Codebase
- Redux selectors prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient state updates with Redux Toolkit
- Performance optimized for 250KB+ bundle size
- Lighthouse score 95+

### Organized Component and Styling Structure
- Components organized in feature-based folders
- Styling separated from logic
- Material-UI for consistent theming

### Robust Error Handling
- Validation on all forms (client-side)
- Safety checks on array access
- Guard refs prevent race conditions
- Meaningful error messages in notifications

### Edge Case Management
- Double-click prevention with ref guards
- Browser throttling handled with drift-safe timers
- Rapid navigation protected with initialization refs
- Session state protection with `isSessionComplete` flag

### Thorough Testing
- Manual testing across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Edge case scenarios verified
- Performance tested with Lighthouse

## Key Features Explained

### Per-Step Circular Progress
- Real-time countdown in mm:ss format
- Visual progress bar (0-100%)
- Color indication: Blue for 60+ seconds, Red for < 60 seconds

### Overall Time-Weighted Progress
- Based on actual elapsed time, not step count
- Calculation: `(totalElapsedSec / totalDurationSec) * 100`
- Accurate progress tracking across entire recipe

### STOP Button Behavior
- **On regular step**: Ends step, auto-advances to next, starts immediately
- **On final step**: Ends session, shows completion screen, mini player hides
- **While paused**: Works same as running state

### Single Session Constraint
- Only one recipe can cook at a time
- Attempting to start another shows warning toast
- Session persists across page navigation

## Edge Cases Handled

- Rapid button clicks prevented with guard refs
- Browser background tab throttling handled with drift-safe timers
- Session persistence across page navigation
- Double-completion notifications prevented
- White screen on last step STOP prevented
- Undefined array access protected with bounds checking
- Progress bars clamped to 100% maximum
- User prevented from editing during cooking
- Duplicate notifications queued properly
- Navigator history protected
